// This is my second time going through this chapter 

- The author posits that "Like arrays, objects in Javascripts are containers [specifically::called: aggregate or complex data types] " 
- In spite of desiring to vomit over this, I'll have to press because the topic is one that any serious developer has to stomach thru

	1. Arrays contain values (duh), indexed numerically (duh)
		objects -> properties indexed by 'string' or 'symbol Symbol()' 
	
	2. Arrays are 'ordered' (arr[0] always comes before arr[1]; 
		objects -> are not ordered and may present themselves in random ways s

* really frustrated with the authors 'jest' at the moment.

Property Enumeration (..sigh)

Enumeration -> list the contents of a container (array) # use arrays 

Objects do not support (property enumeration)

for..in 
* traditional way to enumerate the properties of an object is for..in (consider this example):
	The object has a string properties and lone symbol property
