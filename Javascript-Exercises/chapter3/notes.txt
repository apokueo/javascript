Chapter 3 Notes 

- Explores datatypes (variables, constants and literals) 
- These are mechanisms for holding (storing) data. 

* The author posits that this is often an area that is overlooked (namely, vocabulary) when one is learning to program. He then admonishes us to give the most earnest heed to the things that we're to learn at the onset of our careers, for if there is no proper foundation lain, then certaincalamity ensues. 

Variable(s) and Constant(s): 

	- a variable is a named value, and as the name implies, the value can change at any time

	Ex. let currentTempC = 22;

	Note: the 'let' keyword is new to ES6; in the priori the only option was 'var'. 

	- let can only be used 'once' (behaves like a constant) 

	- take time to name your variables meaningfully as they will help to debug in times when your code chokes 

	- Javascript lets you declare a variable without assigning a value however a value is assigned automatically and that is 'undefined'

	- you can declare multiple variables with the 'same' let statement

	Ex. let targetTempC, room1 = "conference_room_a", room2 = "lobby"; 

	# Constants 

	- a constant (new in ES6) also holds a value, but unlike a variable, can't be changed after initialization. 

	Ex. const ROOM_TEMP_C = 21.5, MAX_TEMP_C = 30; 

	- uppercased constants are more a convention and not a ecma script requisite for our code (provides ease of recognizing constants in your code)

	

	# Theory  -> Why choose variables over constants or vice versa? 

	- when you don't need a value to change, its a good practice to prefer constants over variables, thus making it more difficult to accidently change something that should not


	# Naming your variables and constants: 

	- variables and constant names are called 'identifiers'

	- must only start with ($) or (_) # dollar signs or underscores 

	- consists of letters, numbers, the dollar sign ($) and underscore 

	- unicode characters are allowed also 

	- identifiers cannot be reserved words  

	- camel case (luciferianDoctrines) or snake case (angelic_communication) 

	
	Note: identifiers should 'not' start with captial letters unless they are 'classes'. Additionally avoid double-underscores (__) as this is reserved for special/internal vars


	# Literals 
	- the value in a variable passed to another variable 

	
	
	# {Primitive types and objects} 

	- in js a 'value' is either a 'primitive' or an 'object' 

	- primitives (types) such as strings and numbers are immutable . 

	Ex. 'the number 5 will always be the number 5' and the string 'alpha' will always be 'alpha'

	- There are 6 primitives in javascript: 
		1. Number 
		2. String
		3. Boolean
		4. Null
		5. Undefined
		6. Symbol 

	Note: immutablity has nothing to do with a value in a variable changing, it has to do with 

	- Objects unlike variables can take on different forms and values

		1. Array
		2. Date
		3. RegExp
		4. Map and WeakMap
		5. Set and WeakSet

		Note: Primitive types -> number, string and boolean have corresponding object types, Number, String and Boolean (however they don't actually store a value), 
		      but rather provide functionality that's related to the corresponding primitive. 

	# null and undefined
	- undefined is used by javascript to indicate a declared variable is empty, but is open to the programmer to use - best practice is to avoid using it
	- use null instead 

	Objects 
	- objects unlike primitives can represent multiple and complex values, and can change over a lifetime
	- an object is a container 
	- the literal syntax of objects is ({}) (curly braces)
	
	 Ex. const obj = {}; 
	- name it anything you want but should follow the same rules as with constants and variables 
	- descriptive names 
	- the contents of objects are called properties (or members)
	- properties consist of a name (or key) and value
	- property names must be strings or symbols and values can be any type: including other objects! 


    // Number, String and Boolean Objects 
    - Number, String and Boolean have corresponding types (Number, String, Boolean) that serve 2 purposes and that is to store special variables such as Number.INFINITY
	  and to provide functionality in the form of function.

	Ex. const s = 'hello'; 
	s.toUpperCase(); //hello 
	
	- tho the above example behaves as if it were an object, it really isn't, for its a primitive. 
	
	How? 
	- Javascript is creating a temporaray String object (which has a function toUpperCase, among others)
	- After the function has been called/invoked, Javascript discards the object

	Ex. const s = 'hello'; 
	s.rating = 3; // no error.. success? 
	s.rating; // undefined 

	- its immediately discarded which is why it is returning [undefined]


	// Arrays 
	- arrays are special type of object in javascript 
	- arrays size is not fixed; you can add or remove elements at any time
	- arrays are not homegenous; each individual element can be of any type
	- arrays are zero-based i.e. the first element in the array is element 0
	- array values can be overassigned by assigning a new value 


    // Regular Expressions 
	// Converting to Numbers 
	- if a string can't be converted, NaN will be returned 
	- you can use Number() to convert from string to number 
	- you can also use the parseInt and parseFloat functions 
		a. with parseInt you can specify a radix which is the base with which you want to parse the number (10 is the default)
		b. both parseInt and parseFloat will both discard everything past the radix specified
