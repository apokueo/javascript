Prototypes 
	* Javascript does have inheritance, although this just one way to reuse code! 
	* Inheritance can be accomplished in various ways, which is usually by making use of prototypes

	Prototypes are objects (no surprise) and every function you create automatically gets prototype property that points 
	to a blank object. The object is identical to an object created with an object literal or object constructor (Object()), 
	except the constructor property points to the function you create and not to the built-in Object(). 

	You can add members to this blank object and later have other objects inherit from this object and use its properties as
	their own.
