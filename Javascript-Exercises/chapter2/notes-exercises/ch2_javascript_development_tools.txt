Javascript Development Tools 

- Git, Node, Gulp, Babel and ESLint 

- Git is a 'version control' tool that helps you manage your projects as it grows, and to collaborate with other developers 

- Node, which allows you to run Javascript outside of the browser (and comes with npm, which gives access to the rest of the tools on this list)

- Gulp, a build tool that automates common development tasks to which Grunt is an alternative 

- Babel, a transcompiler that converts ES6 code to portable ES5 code

- ESLint, a linter that helps you avoid common mistakes and makes you a better programmer 
	Note: eslint has a lot of configurable items and one is encouraged to visit the ESLint website in order to gain useful knowledge on these parameters
