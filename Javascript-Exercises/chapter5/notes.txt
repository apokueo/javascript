Expressions and Operators 

- an expression is a special kind of 'statement' that evaluates to a value 
- the distinction between an expression statement (which results in a value) and a 
  non-expression statement (which does not) is critical: understanding the difference
  gives you the tools you need to combine language elements in useful ways

- nonexpression statements should be thought of as 'instruction' 
- expressions request for something

Arithmetic Operators

+ - / * % - + ++ ++ -- --

* all nuumbers in javascript are doubles, meaning if you perform an arithmetic operation on an integer (such as 3/2), the result will be a decimal number (1.5)

* Unary are evaluated before subtraction: 
	Ex. 
		const x = 5; 
		const y = 3 - -x; // y is 8

		Operator Precedence 

		* see chart in "Javascript the Weird Parts" 

Note: same thing applies for (+) unary plus operator
