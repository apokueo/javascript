                  <h1>Package Managment<h1>


      npm is a Nodes package manager that allows you to add dependencies for setting up a developmental build environment.

      // will get all specified dependencies in json file.
      npm install -package name-

      // targets a specific version
      npm install -package name@1.8.0

      // dependencies vs dev dependencies

       tagging dependencies by attaching the --save or --saveDev flag to the end of dependency you are installing.

       ex. npm install --save underscore
           npm instal --save-dev underscore

      dev dependencies are packages your app can run without, but help with the building a project.


      <h1>Build Tools</h1>

      2 popular build tools for Javascript are Gulp and Grunt

      // Installs gulp build tool globally
