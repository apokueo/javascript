                            <h1> Chapter 3 : Data </h1>

    all data is represented by 0's and 1's

    data types are the representations of that data and each language can have its own data type.

    objects with the ability to hold data : ( variables, constants, and literals )

    // values can change at any time with vars wit ha simple reassignment.

    ~ variables = 'named value';

    // const however has its initial value set and does not change from that set value.

    ~ const Max_Temp_C = 24;

    the let keyword in the new ES6 allows for the declaration of multiple variables with only using one let command.

    let users, env1 = "Sales", env2 = "Collaboration"

          <h1> Identifier Names </h1>


    Variable and Constant (NAMES) are called Identifiers and those names have conventions.

    Identifiers must start with a (letter: [a,b,c], dollarSign: [$], underscore: [_])

    unicode is allowed
    identifiers cannot be reserved words


    ~ Note about casing

      camelCasing = "currentCamel"
      snake_casing = "snake_in_the_grass"

    ~ Note on identifiers

    should not start with uppercasing
    except for class identifiers





                    <h1> Literals </h1>


    literal - providing the value directly in the program.

    let room1 = "conference_room_a"

    /* room1 = "identifier"
       "conerence_room_a" = string literal
    */
