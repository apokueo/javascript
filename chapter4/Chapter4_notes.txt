## Chapter 4 Notes 

### While Loops
	
	-A while loop repeats code as long as its condition is met(true).
		
let funds = 50; 	// starting conditions

while(funds > 1 && funds < 100) {
	// place bets
	
	// roll dice

	// collect winnings
}


### Block Statements
	
	- Block statements (sometimes called compound statements) are not control flow statements, but they go hand in hand with them.  A block
	statement is just a series of statements enclosed in curly braces that is treated by JavaScript as a single unit.  While it is possible to
	have a block statement by itself, it has little utility. For example:

{  // start block statement
	console.log("statement 1");
	console.log("statement 2");
} // end block statement

console.log("statement 3");

	-Block statements become useful with control flow statements.  For example, the loop we're executing with our while statement will execute the entire block statement before testing the condition again.

let funds = 50; 	// starting conditions

while(funds > 1 && funds < 100) {

	funds = funds + 2; // two steps forward

	funds = funds - 1; // one step back
}
