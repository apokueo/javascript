## Chapter 4 Notes 

### While Loops
	
	-A while loop repeats code as long as its condition is met(true).
		
let funds = 50; 	// starting conditions

while(funds > 1 && funds < 100) {
	// place bets
	
	// roll dice

	// collect winnings
}


### Block Statements
	
	- Block statements (sometimes called compound statements) are not control flow statements, but they go hand in hand with them.  A block
	statement is just a series of statements enclosed in curly braces that is treated by JavaScript as a single unit.  While it is possible to
	have a block statement by itself, it has little utility. For example:

{  // start block statement
	console.log("statement 1");
	console.log("statement 2");
} // end block statement

console.log("statement 3");

	-Block statements become useful with control flow statements.  For example, the loop we're executing with our while statement will execute the entire block statement before testing the condition again.

let funds = 50; 	// starting conditions

while(funds > 1 && funds < 100) {

	funds = funds + 2; // two steps forward

	funds = funds - 1; // one step back
}

	-Block statement w/ control flow is not required.

let funds = 50; // starting conditions

while(funds > 1 && funds < 100)
	funds = funds + 2;

### Whitespace

	-JavaScript doesn't care about additional whitespace (including newlines): 1 space is as good as 10, or 10 spaces and 10 newlines.  This
	doesn't mean you should use whitespace capriciously. 
	For example, the preceding 'while' statement is equivalent to:

		while(funds > 1 && funds < 100)
		
		funds = funds + 2;

	-But this hardly makes it look as if the two statements are connected! Using this formatting is very misleading, and should be avoided.  The 
	 following equivalents, however, are relatively common, and mostly unambiguous:
	
		// no newline
		while(funds > 1 && funds < 100) funds = funds + 2;

		// no newline, block with one statement
		while(funds > 1 && funds < 100) { funds = funds + 2; }

	-There are those who insist that control flow statement bodies - for the sake of consistency and clarity - should always be a block statement
	(even if they contain only one statement).  While I do not fall in this camp, I should point out that careless indentation fuels the fire of
	this argument:

		while(funds > 1 && funds < 100)
			funds = funds + 2;
			funds = funds + 1;

	-At a glance, it looks like the body of the while loop is executing two statements (two steps forward and one step back), but because there's no block statement here, JavaScript interprets this as:

	while(funds > 1 && funds < 100)
		funds = funds + 2;		//while loop body

	  funds = funds - 1;			// after while loop

 

	-One syntactically valid choice is nearly universally reviled:  mixing blocks and single statements in the same 'if' statement:

	//don't do this
	if(funds > 1) {
		console.log("There's money left!");
		console.log("That means keep playing!");
	} else
		console.log("I'm broke! Time to quit.");

	// or this
	if(funds > 1)
		console.log("There's money left!  Keep playing!");
	else  {
		console.log("I'm broke"!);
		console.log("Time to quit.")
	}


### Helper Functions

	-To follow along with the examples in this chapter, we'll need two 'helper functions'.  
		
		// returns a random integer in the range [m, n] (inclusive)
		function rand(m, n) {
			return m + Math.floor((n - m + 1)"Math.random ());
		}

		// randomly returns a string representing one of the six
		// Crown and Anchor faces
		function randFace() {
			return ["crown", "anchor", "heart", "spade", "clud", "diamond"]
				[rand(0,5)];
		}



### if...else Statement

	const bets = { crown: 0, anchor: 0, heart: 0,
		spade: 0, club: 0, diamond: 0 };
	let totalBet = rand(1, funds);
	if(totalBet === 7) {
		totalBet = funds;
		bets.heart = totalBet;
	} else {
		// distribute total bet
	}
	funds = funds - totalBet;


### do...while Loop

	-Note how this differs from the 'while' loop: the decision comes at the end, not the beginning. 'do...while loops are for when you know you 
	always want to execute the body of the loop at least once (if the condition in a while loop starts off as falsy, it won't ever run once). Now 		in JavaScript:
		
		let remaining = totalBet;
		do {
			let bet = rand(1, remaining);
			let face = randFace();
			bets[face] = bets[face] + bet;
			remaining = remaining - bet;
		} while(remaining > 0);


### for Loop
	
	-The 'for' loop is extremely flexible (it can even replace a 'while' or 'do
